// --- I2C OLED (SSD1306, driven over software I2C by U8g2) --------------
#define PIN_SDA 5
#define PIN_SCL 6

// --- Push buttons (active-low, wired to GND, internal pull-ups) --------
// NOTE: GPIO2 is an ESP32-C3 strapping pin. With INPUT_PULLUP it idles
// HIGH, which is the level the bootloader expects, so BTN_A is safe as
// long as the button is not held down during power-up / flashing. Move it
// to a free GPIO if that ever causes boot trouble. GPIO3 and GPIO4 are not
// strapping pins. (Buttons are wired but unused in Phase 1.)
#define PIN_BTN_A 2
#define PIN_BTN_B 3
#define PIN_BTN_C 4

// --- On-board BOOT button (GPIO9) --------------------------------------
// GPIO9 is the ESP32-C3 strapping pin: holding it LOW during power-up
// enters flash-download mode. After boot it is just a normal input — used
// here as a "next expression" button. Don't hold it while powering on.
#define PIN_BTN_BOOT 9

// --- Passive piezo buzzer ----------------------------------------------
#define PIN_BUZZER 10

// --- Vibe-mode SYNC input ----------------------------------------------
// Beat pulse from the DJ device on a shared bus (see DJ-Plan.md). GPIO0 on
// the ESP32-C3 is *not* a strapping pin (unlike on the classic ESP32) and
// is otherwise free on the SuperMini header, so it's a clean choice. The
// pin idles via internal pulldown — the line floats while the DJ is still
// booting, so without the pulldown we would fire spurious beat interrupts.
#define PIN_SYNC 0

// --- OLED panel --------------------------------------------------------
// U8g2's NONAME constructor already targets I2C address 0x3C; OLED_ADDR is
// kept for reference and for any future driver swap.
#define OLED_ADDR 0x3C
#define OLED_W 128
#define OLED_H 64
