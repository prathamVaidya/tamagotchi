# Tamagotchi Firmware

Firmware for an ESP32-C3 SuperMini virtual pet. A 128x64 SSD1306 OLED
shows an animated face and a piezo buzzer gives it a voice.

## Modes

The pet has two modes and switches between them on its own:

- **Free Mode** — the default; it boots into this. The pet runs
  autonomously: it wanders through *moods* and shows matching expressions,
  with no host needed.
- **Desktop Mode** — entered the moment any serial command arrives. The
  pet shows exactly what it is told.

After ~60 s with no command, Desktop Mode drifts back to Free Mode. (To
return to Free Mode immediately, just reboot — it boots into Free Mode.)

## BOOT button

The on-board **BOOT button** (GPIO9) cycles to the next expression on each
tap, stepping through all 12 faces. A tap also hands control to Desktop
Mode (so the choice sticks), so the pet drifts back to Free Mode ~60 s
after the last tap. Don't *hold* the button while powering on — that puts
the chip in flash-download mode.

## Serial command protocol

One command per line, at **115200 baud**. Responses come back one per
line — `OK`, `ERR <reason>`, or a data payload. Keywords are
case-insensitive. Receiving any command switches the pet to Desktop Mode.

| Command              | Effect                                       | Response                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `SHOW face <name>`   | Switch to the face view, set the expression  | `OK` / `ERR unknown face`        |
| `SHOW text <string>` | Switch to the text view (`<string>` = rest)  | `OK`                             |
| `SHOW image <b64>`   | Push a 128×64 1bpp frame, MSB-first packed   | `OK` / `ERR bad image base64`    |
| `SET mood <name>`    | Set the pet's mood (drives Free Mode)        | `OK` / `ERR unknown mood`        |
| `GET state`          | Query the current view + expression          | `{"view":"face","expr":"happy"}` |
| `GET fps`            | Query the current display frame rate         | `fps 38`                         |
| `LIST faces`         | List all expression names                    | `neutral,happy,sad,...`          |
| `PING`               | Liveness check                               | `PONG`                           |

Anything unrecognized returns `ERR unknown command`.

Expressions: `neutral`, `happy`, `sad`, `sleepy`, `excited`, `surprised`,
`angry`, `blink`, `love`, `horny`, `shy`, `dead`.

Moods: `content`, `playful`, `grumpy`, `sleepy`, `affectionate`.

## Free Mode

Each mood has a pool of expressions the pet tends to show:

| Mood         | Tends to show               |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| Content      | neutral, happy, blink       |
| Playful      | happy, excited, surprised   |
| Grumpy       | angry, sad, neutral         |
| Sleepy       | sleepy, blink, neutral      |
| Affectionate | love, happy, shy            |

It picks a fresh expression every ~10–17 s, and every ~45–90 s the mood
may drift to a new one (a gentle random walk, with `content` as home).
`SET mood` sets the mood; it keeps drifting afterward. `horny` and `dead`
are kept out of the autonomous rotation — they are manual-only.

## The image view

`SHOW image <base64>` paints a host-supplied 128×64 1-bit bitmap on the
OLED — 1024 bytes of pixels (16 bytes per row, MSB = leftmost pixel),
base64-encoded. The bitmap stays on screen until the next view command.
The CLI's `tamagotchi image <file>` does the resize / dither / pack /
encode automatically.

## The face

Every expression is drawn procedurally — no sprite bitmaps — so each one
animates: the eyes blink, the gaze drifts, and each expression has its
own idle motion (a sliding tear, floating `Z`s, a tremble, pulsing
hearts, ...). Changing expression plays a blink — eyes close, the new
face swaps in, eyes reopen. Text wider than the screen scrolls.

## The buzzer

A passive piezo buzzer on **GPIO10** plays a short jingle matching the
face. In Desktop Mode every expression change jingles; in Free Mode it
stays quieter — a jingle plays only when the mood shifts. Non-blocking
(LEDC-driven).

## Manual test checklist

1. **Boot** — the OLED comes up in Free Mode; the face changes on its own.
2. `SHOW face happy` — switches to Desktop Mode, blinks into happy; `OK`.
3. `SHOW face love` — heart eyes, blush, a pulsing beat + jingle.
4. `SET mood playful` — `OK`; the mood is set for when Free Mode resumes.
5. `GET state` / `GET fps` / `PING` — query responses.
6. `SHOW face banana` — `ERR unknown face`.
7. **BOOT button** — tap it; the face steps to the next expression.
8. **Idle** — stop sending commands; after ~60 s it returns to Free Mode.
